# Autobyteus

**Autobyteus** is an open-source project designed to transform product development processes by integrating large language models (LLMs) into every lifecycle stage. Our long-term goal is to provide a single platform that enhances collaboration, automates tasks, and streamlines workflows across all roles in product development. This includes leveraging LLMs to push automation and improve efficiency in cooperation, documentation, coding, and beyond.
